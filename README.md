# CHAMPS

A simple app in TypeScript for managing teams, players, and games, intendend for a videogame competition among friends.

With it, you can:
  - add/remove players and teams
  - start multiple editions (and name them)
  - auto generate schedule for games based on chosen teams to participate (you can choose single or double round robin)
  - have separate rosters for separate editions
  - input scores by game, as well as who scored and/or assisted
  - auto updates the results and top goal scorers and assists
  - import and export a JSON file for re-usability and keeping the information safe(r).

## Should I use it?

- Probably not, this is a specific use case for me and my friends, mainly to move away from Excel spreadsheets.

## Author notes

- This is my first working application and one that made me thoroughly enjoy learning JavaScript/TypeScript.

## Collaborators

- Eduardo Grigolo, aka TheMentorist [ @azedo ]
