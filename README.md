# team-management-example
A simple app (at least initially) for managing teams, players, and games

## TODO
- ~~Create a simple HTML page~~
- ~~Create a localStorage DB~~
- ~~Add items to the DB~~
- ~~Remove items from the DB~~
- ~~Create a games table~~
- ~~Create games with registered teams and save it to the DB~~
- ~~Improve the Teams object (add more data to it)~~
- ~~Create a Players "table" with players entries~~
- Create a method to attach a team id to a player
- Create a method to recreate a games table from a certain edition (mainly to bypass accidental refreshes that wipe the table but maintain the information in the games database)
- Verify if creating helper functions to save, edit and remove teams, players and games is better than having three separate functions for the different databases
- Organize what is displayed to the user
